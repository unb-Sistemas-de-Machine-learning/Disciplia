  - Once you have used all 4 late days, the penalty is 20% for each additional late day.
  - In case of medical or other personal emergencies, further extensions can be approved. Contact the instructor in that case.
  - Other accommodations may be accepted, but only if communicated directly to the instructor at least <b>2 in advance of the deadline</b>.
